# Face_Detector_using_python

save the "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" file 
attached along the code in the same 
folder in which the code file is saved.

This piece of code perfectly works on Jupyter Notebook
but need some working in installing opencv library in
idle or other plateforms

Thank You.
